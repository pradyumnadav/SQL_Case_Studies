FROM balanced_tree.sales
```

# Transaction Analysis

## 1. How many unique transactions were there?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS count_transactions
FROM balanced_tree.sales
```

## 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
- Find the number of products purchased in each transaction i.e quantity. Then find the overall average

```sql

WITH CTE AS(
SELECT txn_id, SUM(qty) AS num_prods
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(num_prods),1) AS unique_prods_purchased 
FROM CTE
```

## 3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

- Discount is given in percentage. Therefore revenue = quantity * price * (1 - discount / 100)
- The PERCENTILE_CONT() function can be used to find the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of revenues.

```sql
WITH transaction_revenues AS(
  SELECT txn_id, SUM(qty * price * (1 - discount/100)) AS revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY txn_id
)

SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(revenue, 0.25) OVER() AS percentile_25 , PERCENTILE_CONT(revenue, 0.5) OVER() AS percentile_50, PERCENTILE_CONT(revenue, 0.75) OVER() AS percentile_75
FROM transaction_revenues
LIMIT 1
```

## 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(discount_value),2) AS avg_discount_value
FROM (SELECT txn_id, SUM((qty * price * (discount/100))) AS discount_value
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id)
```

## 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
```sql
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN member = TRUE THEN txn_id END)/COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) * 100, 1) AS pct_member, ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN member = FALSE THEN txn_id END)/COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) * 100,1) AS pct_non_member
FROM balanced_tree.sales
```

## 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
```sql
WITH total_revenues AS(
SELECT member, txn_id, SUM(qty * price * (1 - discount/100)) AS revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY member, txn_id
)
SELECT member, ROUND(AVG(revenue),2) AS avg_revenue
FROM total_revenues
GROUP BY member
